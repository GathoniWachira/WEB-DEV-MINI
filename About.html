    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div class="text-block">
      <p>Tess Gathoni was a whirlwind of contradictions. Her laughter could fill a room, yet her gaze held the secrets of ancient forests. Sun-kissed skin spoke of days spent exploring untamed landscapes, while the glint in her eyes hinted at a mind forever yearning for the next intellectual challenge. Her wardrobe mirrored her personality: a vibrant clash of bohemian patterns and tailored precision, each piece whispering of adventures past and dreams yet to unfold. An artist at heart, her soul expressed itself in vibrant brushstrokes and the rhythm of self-taught melodies. Yet, beneath the artistic exterior, resided a steely resolve, a determination forged in the fires of self-reliance. Whether scaling mountains or delving into philosophy texts, Tess Gathoni approached life with the same fiery passion, leaving an indelible mark on all who encountered her.</p>
